# MyTrashCode

Only trash code that I use for testing or anything without a purpose, such as academic exercises or other stuf.

I know I should not be combining multiple projects into one repository and should instead separate them into different repositories. However, I want to keep them in one place and ensure that everything is up-to-date on multiple computers.

Nothing useful here.
